{"request": "Q: There's a small furniture store that has been running a loud generator and disturbing the neighborhood in their alleyway. My backyard and home is directly next to the alleyway. They have been running the generator since October 2022, its loud and annoying and is usually on for 7-8 hours daily. The odd thing is, the store is usually closed but the generator is turned on daily. I have lived in my home for nearly 30 years and never had such an annoying issue from the alleyway. I've made noise complaints many times but it doesn't do anything. The noise is making myself and other neighbors uncomfortable in our homes, its interfering with our daily lives. For eight hours we are held prisoner by the constant sound of a loud generator in our ears. We just want some peace and to be able to take naps during the day again. We can't even go into our backyard. I do not know why the owners of the store do not get the electrical issue fixed. Is there anything I can do to get back our peace? Making noise complaints to the police is doing nothing. Who can force them to fix the problem?

The car was sold to her for $10,000 but she ended up with a total of $15,562 with tax. Carvana claims they do a 5 point inspection on the engine, transmission and everything else on the car. She keeps up with maintenance like, changing oil and refilling up as you should. I did my own research on YouTube on Carvana and seen countless of news stories of people having the same exact issue, engine or transmission blew, car wont start, Carvana not sending out titles months to a year after car is paid off. She has two kids, ages 2 and 6. She also does work for Instacart so she uses her car for work. We believe no 5 point inspection was done and they knew about the issue before they sold it to her.

{"request": "Q: Can Landlord charge more rent if it's 2 tenants a room vs 1 tenant? What legal reasons?. 1) Let's say the rent for 1 bedroom is $1000 for 1 person. How much more can I charge for 2 people? I see online ppl charing 15-25% more? I see some sites say that you have to specify how utilities are calculated but I don't see how to do that because utilities differ depending on how much AC or space heaters are used, how much each tenant uses etc. If I don't have separate meters for each room (3-4 rooms) and then there's factoring in future inflation since PG&E just did a 12% increase and again soon. There's really no stable number every month. 2) Can it only be for utilities? Having another occupant means that I would have 1 more person I'd have to be liable for in the case of injury or fire etc. more wear and tear and thus more maintenance, increase chances of them breaking something.
